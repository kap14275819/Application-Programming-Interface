## Relationship between API and SDK

#### An API is simply an interface that allows software to interact with other software. APIs come in many shapes and sizes. The browser that a reader would likely use to peruse the Nordic APIs website uses a variety of API sets in order to convert user commands into usable functions, request data from servers, render that data into a viewable format for the user, and validate the performance of their requests.

#### Even something as simple as copying and pasting on a computer utilizes an API. Copying text converts a keystroke into a command, data is stored into RAM on the clipboard utilizing an API, the data is then carried from one application to another using that same API, and finally, data is rendered when pasting using yet another API.
