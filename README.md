## Relationship between API and SDK

## What is an API?

#### API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. It specifies a set of rules that should be followed by programs to communicate with each other. APIs usually explain how the different types of routines, data structures, etc. should be defined in order for two applications to communicate. APIs differ in the functionality provided by them. For example, library functionalities of a programming language are provided by general APIs such as the Java API. Also there are then APIs that provide specific functionalities such as the Google Maps API. Then there are APIs that could only be used by a specific programming language which are language dependent APIs. Additionally, there are also a few language independent APIs that can be then used with several programming languages. When implementing an API this must be done very carefully as the only things that should be exposed is the required functionality or the outside data that is public, whilst keeping other parts of the application inaccessible. The usage of APIs has become very popular on the internet. It is now very common to allow some of the functionality and data through an API on the web. This functionality can be combined to offer an improved functionality to the users.

## What is an SDK?

#### An SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. SDKs usually provide various tools, libraries, documentation and some sample code that would then help any programmer using it to develop an application. Most of the SDKs available can also be downloaded from the internet and many of them are provided for free so that it may encourage to use the SDK's programming language. There a few widely used SDKs such as the Java SDK which includes all the libraries, debugging utilities, etc., which allows writing programs much smoother in Java. Using and SDK makes the work of any software developer much easier, this is because there is no need to look for components/tools that are compatible with each other and all of them are integrated in to a single package that is easy to install.


### What is the difference between API and SDK?

#### SDKs and APIs are commonly used to integrate important features like security and communications into the web and mobile apps. Each of them provide similar benefits but they also have specific differences. So an SDK is kind of like a box of cake mix. It contains pre-built functionality that then allows the cake to be baked faster and easier. 

#### Whilst an API is more like the recipe that is used to bake the cake. It has the set of instructions but also gives some room to be creative within the recipe. The result will still be the same, but without having any knowledge/experience it will be more difficult and will have some unintended consequences. Additionally, with the cake mix you are also able to create other items instead of just a cake such as pancakes, but also you are able to add different flavours; the same way each SDK is a software toolset which is sepcially designed for a given language or platform to interact with the underlying services. Even though there are appropriate uses for each, there are distinctive benefits of an SDK over an API. Such as, easier integration, built-in security, and cost. 

### Easier Integration
#### Firstly, with pre-build functionality, integrating an SDK into an app will be so much easier. SDKs are able to simplify standard processed such as creating authorisation signatures or parsing SMS messages in a native language or platform, which then helps greatly with the complexity of the integration. Developers do not need to have a huge amount of experience on the SDKs topic to be able to use it, this is because most SDKs possess the programming tools, documentation and sample code needed to ensure that they can be continuously plugged in to the apps. With the easy integration this also allows the developers to launch their apps faster without having to spend time and money on developing complex infrastructures or processes. 

#### APIs on the other hand require much more depth of knowledge of the product that is being integrated which is also included with the development of the software for integrating the API. Hence, adding on more research and development complexity. API integration will not be as easy as SDKs so the process will take longer since it can demand expetise in several areas of functionality based on the technology in use. 

### Security
#### SDKs can really stand out when it comes to security, especially when apps and services are becoming more and more interconnected. The complexity of security systems can be sometimes really extreme, and usually require huge teams of experts to develop, update and test. SDKs allows businesses to make it possible for them to add important security easily, whether it is used to block fraud or to enforce security requirements such as storing sensitive information. 

#### One of the biggest advantages of SDks is that it has the ability to have deep integration with a native platform such as Android and IOS to provide end to end integration of service for a more secure overall solution. This can be easily missed when using APIs, but on the other hand it is important to keep in mind that even though SDKs are more secure, it is best to ensure that the SDK that is being used is a stable version that is actively being developed from creators that you trust to be as secure as you need them to be.

### Cost 
#### Cost will always be one of the most important factors when building a new platform. SDKs can help here as well. Between reduced development cycle time and the ability to leverage expertise and fully-realized coding, integrating SDKs instead of APIs can save your business a huge chunk of cash.

### Conclusion
#### Even though there has not been that many advantages for APIs, but there are definitely certain areas in which APIs can stand out. But in the end SDKs are meant to provide developers with the expertise and solutions they need, and to get them up and running quickly and easily. SDKs com premade with a huge amount of benfits that save companies time and money, and they have the ability to allow developers to stay up to date with the latest features without having to research themselves. So, if you are building a new app and want to separate yourself from the crowded mobile landscape, but don’t have the resources to build everything yourself, it might be better off to try SDKs to give you the features you need to grow and excite your users.
