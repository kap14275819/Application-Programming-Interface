## Relationship between API and SDK

### What is an API?

#### API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. It specifies a set of rules that should be followed by the programs to communicate with each other. APIs usually explains how the different types of routines, data structures, etc. should be defined in order for two applications to communicate. APIs differ in the functionality provided by them. For example, library functionalities of a programming language are provided by general APIs such as the Java API. Also there are then APIs that provide specific funtionalities such as the Google Maps API. Then there are APIs that could only be used by a specific programming language which are language dependent APIs. Additionally, there are also a few language independent APIs that can be then used with several programming languages.          


APIs needs to be implemented very carefully by exposing only the required functionality or data to the outside, while keeping the other parts of the application inaccessible. Usage of APIs has become very popular in the internet. It has become very common to allow some of the functionality and data through an API to the outside on the Web. This functionality can be combined to offer an improved functionality to the users.

### What is an SDK?

#### SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. SDKs include tools, libraries, documentation and sample code that would help a programmer to develop an application. Most of the SDKs could be downloaded from the internet and many of the SDKs are provided free to encourage the programmers to use the SDKâ€˜s programming language. Some widely used SDKs are Java SDK (JDK) that includes all the libraries, debugging utilities, etc., which would make writing programs much easier in Java. SDKs make the life of a software developer easy, since there is no need to look for components/ tools that are compatible with each other and all of them are integrated in to a single package that is easy to install.


What is the difference between API and SDK?

API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other, whereas a SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. The simplest version of a SDK could be an API that contains some files required to interact with a specific programming language. So an API can be seen as a simple SDK without all the debugging support, etc.
