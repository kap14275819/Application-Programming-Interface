## Relationship between API and SDK

## What is an API?

#### API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. It specifies a set of rules that should be followed by programs to communicate with each other. APIs usually explain how the different types of routines, data structures, etc. should be defined in order for two applications to communicate. APIs differ in the functionality provided by them. For example, library functionalities of a programming language are provided by general APIs such as the Java API. Also there are then APIs that provide specific functionalities such as the Google Maps API. Then there are APIs that could only be used by a specific programming language which are language dependent APIs. Additionally, there are also a few language independent APIs that can be then used with several programming languages. When implementing an API this must be done very carefully as the only things that should be exposed is the required functionality or the outside data that is public, whilst keeping other parts of the application inaccessible. The usage of APIs has become very popular on the internet. It is now very common to allow some of the functionality and data through an API on the web. This functionality can be combined to offer an improved functionality to the users.

## What is an SDK?

#### An SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. SDKs usually provide various tools, libraries, documentation and some sample code that would then help any programmer using it to develop an application. Most of the SDKs available can also be downloaded from the internet and many of them are provided for free so that it may encourage to use the SDK's programming language. There a few widely used SDKs such as the Java SDK which includes all the libraries, debugging utilities, etc., which allows writing programs much smoother in Java. Using and SDK makes the work of any software developer much easier, this is because there is no need to look for components/tools that are compatible with each other and all of them are integrated in to a single package that is easy to install.


### What is the difference between API and SDK?

#### SDKs and APIs are commonly used to integrate important features like security and communications into the web and mobile apps. Each of them provide similar benefits but they also have specific differences. So an SDK is kind of like a box of cake mix. It contains pre-built functionality that then allows the cake to be baked faster and easier. 

#### Whilst an API is more like the recipe that is used to bake the cake. It has the set of instructions but also gives some room to be creative within the recipe. The result will still be the same, but without having any knowledge/experience it will be more difficult and will have some unintended consequences. Additionally, with the cake mix you are also able to create other items instead of just a cake such as pancakes, but also you are able to add different flavours; the same way each SDK is a software toolset which is sepcially designed for a given language or platform to interact with the underlying services. Even though there are appropriate uses for each, there are distinctive benefits of an SDK over an API. Such as, easier integration, faster time to market, build-in security, and cost savings. 

### Easier Integration
#### Firstly, with pre-build functionality, integrating an SDK into an app will be so much easier. SDKs are able to simplify standard processed such as creating authorisation signatures or parsing SMS messages in a native language or platform, which then helps greatly with the complexity of the integration. Developers do not need to have a huge amount of experience on the SDKs topic to be able to use it, this is because most SDKs possess the programming tools, documentation and sample code needed to ensure that they can be continuously plugged in to the apps.

#### APIs on the other hand require much more depth of knowledge of the product that is being integrated which is also included with the development of the software for integrating the API. Hence, adding on more research and development complexity.
